# Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem With Time Windows As A Mixed Integer Linear Program
A MILP formulation of the capacitated vehicle routing problem with time windows (CVRPTW). We use soft time windows with a weighted penalty in the objective function to discourage lateness while maintaining feasibility at all times.

To run the code, simply run
